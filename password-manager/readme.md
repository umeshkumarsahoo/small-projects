## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python installations)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/umeshkumarsahoo/password-manager.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd password-manager
   ```

3. Ensure you have the required Python packages (Tkinter is included with Python by default).

### Usage

1. Open the project directory and run the `password_manager.py` file:

   ```bash
   python password_manager.py
   ```

2. The application window will open with the password manager interface. Use the **Generate Password** button to create a new password and the **Add** button to save the details.

3. Enter the website name, email, and password into the respective fields. Confirm the details in the popup dialog before they are saved to `data.txt`.

### Configuration

- **Password Length and Complexity**: The password is generated with a random combination of letters, numbers, and symbols. You can modify the generation logic in the `password_manager.py` file if needed.

### Notes

- The application uses a PNG image (e.g., `pass.png`) for visual aesthetics. Ensure the image file is available in the project directory or replace it as needed.
