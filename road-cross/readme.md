# Road Crossing Game üê¢üöó

A fun and challenging road crossing game implemented using Python's Turtle module. In this game, the player controls a turtle that must cross a busy road filled with moving cars. The goal is to reach the other side without getting hit by a car.

## Features

- **Player Movement:** Control the turtle using the up arrow key to navigate through the traffic.
- **Car Generation:** Randomly generated cars that move across the screen, with increasing speed as the player progresses.
- **Score Tracking:** Keeps track of the player's score, which increases with each successful crossing.
- **Game Over:** The game ends when the turtle collides with a car.
